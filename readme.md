# Cheat Engine Cheat Table Usage Guide

## Introduction
Cheat Engine (CE) is an advanced memory scanning, disassembly, and debugging tool that facilitates runtime memory modification through manual manipulation or automated Cheat Tables (`.ct` files). These structured scripts leverage pointer resolution, assembly injection, and real-time value overwriting to achieve deterministic or heuristic-based memory alterations. This guide provides a highly technical overview of the optimal workflow for harnessing Cheat Tables to manipulate volatile memory states efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- **Cheat Engine** (latest stable build, or a custom-compiled version for maximum control)
- **Target Process** (i.e., a running instance of the game binary within memory)
- **Cheat Table (`.ct` file)** tailored for the game's version, architecture (x86/x64), and memory layout
- **Knowledge of Assembly (optional but recommended for ASM script modifications)**

## Workflow: Utilizing a Cheat Table in Cheat Engine

### 1. Acquire the Cheat Table
- Download or create a `.ct` file that corresponds with the game’s memory structure.
- If utilizing a manually constructed Cheat Table, ensure the pointer chains are resolved properly.
- (Optional) Store `.ct` files within CE’s working directory for rapid access.

### 2. Launch Cheat Engine
- Execute `CheatEngine.exe` with elevated privileges (Administrator mode recommended for kernel-level access).

### 3. Initialize Target Process
- Launch the game and allow all relevant memory regions to be allocated.
- For deterministic manipulation, avoid state-changing events before scanning.

### 4. Attach Cheat Engine to the Target Process
- Use `ALT+TAB` to bring Cheat Engine into focus.
- Click the **Process List** icon (depicted as a PC icon in CE’s UI).
- Identify and select the active process for the target executable (e.g., `GameX.exe`).
- Click **Open** to hook Cheat Engine’s debugger into the memory space.

### 5. Load the Cheat Table
#### If the Cheat Table is in Cheat Engine’s Working Directory:
- CE automatically detects an associated `.ct` file and prompts for auto-load.
- Click **YES** to proceed.

#### If the Cheat Table Resides in an External Directory:
- Press `CTRL + O` or navigate to `File` > `Load`.
- Locate and select the `.ct` file.
- Click **Open** to import the script.

### 6. Activate Scripts and Modify Memory Values
- The Cheat Table will display a structured breakdown of scriptable modifications and memory regions.
- **To enable a script:** Check the activation box next to the relevant cheat (e.g., `God Mode`).
- **To modify direct memory values:**
  - Locate the corresponding address (e.g., `Money: 5000`).
  - Double-click the value field and manually override the stored value.
  - If necessary, apply a freeze (`Lock`) to prevent value restoration via game logic.

## Use Cases & Advanced Examples
### Example 1: Enabling God Mode via ASM Injection
1. Attach Cheat Engine to the process.
2. Load the Cheat Table.
3. Locate the `God Mode - ASM Injection` script.
4. Enable the script, triggering an `MOV EAX, 999` override within the health register.
5. Resume gameplay and confirm the applied invulnerability.

### Example 2: Locating a Dynamic Address and Hooking It
1. Perform an **Initial Scan** using `Exact Value` for a known in-game metric (e.g., `Health: 100`).
2. Take damage to modify the memory state.
3. Perform a **Next Scan** with the updated value.
4. Iterate scanning until a singular memory address remains.
5. Right-click the address and select **Add to Address List**.
6. Modify the value manually or apply a pointer scan to locate the base pointer.
7. (Advanced) Inject an inline `NOP` operation to suppress decrementing behavior.

### Example 3: Debugging with Breakpoints and Memory Inspection
1. Attach CE to the target process.
2. Identify a critical memory address (e.g., enemy AI logic controlling hit detection).
3. Right-click the address and set a **Breakpoint**.
4. Trigger the relevant in-game event (e.g., taking damage) to invoke the breakpoint.
5. Analyze the stack, registers, and assembly instructions at runtime.
6. Modify relevant opcodes (e.g., replacing `DEC EAX` with `NOP`) to alter behavior persistently.

## Debugging & Troubleshooting
- **Process Not Detectable:** Ensure the game is running with `Run as Administrator`. If the game employs anti-debugging mechanisms, use CE’s **Stealth Mode**.
- **Cheat Table Not Functioning:** Validate the `.ct` file against the game version; address offsets often shift post-patch.
- **Values Revert Instantly:** Some memory regions utilize dynamic allocation; use a pointer scan to locate the base address.
- **Game Crashes on Modification:** Certain memory spaces employ integrity checks; consider debugging and identifying checksum routines.

## Security & Ethical Considerations
- **Use Ethically:** Modifying single-player memory is generally acceptable, but altering networked values in multiplayer environments may trigger bans.
- **Anti-Cheat Mechanisms:** Games with kernel-mode anti-cheats (e.g., Vanguard, EAC, BattleEye) may flag CE as a threat.
- **Memory Integrity Checks:** Some modern titles use signature-based validation to detect modified instructions; apply script obfuscation or bypass mechanisms where applicable.
- **Avoid Permanent Data Corruption:** Always maintain backups of save files prior to executing memory modifications.
